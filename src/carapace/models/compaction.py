"""Compaction summary tree persisted alongside a session's history.

The model history (``SessionHistoryRow``) holds the compacted *cut*: folded turns are
replaced by a single marked synthetic assistant message, and large tool returns are
replaced by shorter summaries stamped on ``ToolReturnPart.metadata``. This module stores
the human/debug-facing tree of summary nodes so the UI can render collapsible blocks,
the agent-view toggle, and (later) consolidate adjacent summaries.

Originals are never stored here — they remain in the events transcript and git archive.
